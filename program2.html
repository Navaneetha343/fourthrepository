<h6> Cougar</h6>
<p> The cougar (Puma concolor) is a large cat native to the Americas. Its range spans from the
        Canadian Yukon to the southern Andes in South America and is the most widespread of any large wild terrestrial
        mammal in the Western Hemisphere. It is an adaptable, generalist species, occurring in most American habitat
        types. This wide range has brought it many common names, including puma, mountain lion, catamount and panther
        (for the Florida sub-population). It is the second-largest cat in the New World, after the jaguar (Panthera
        onca). Secretive and largely solitary by nature, the cougar is properly considered both nocturnal and
        crepuscular, although daytime sightings do occur. Despite its size, the cougar is more closely related to
        smaller felines, including the domestic cat (Felis catus) than to any species of the subfamily Pantherinae.</p>
<h6> Naming and etymology</h6>
<p>
The word cougar is borrowed from the Portuguese çuçuarana, via French; it was originally derived from the Tupi
        language. A current form in Brazil is suçuarana.[3] In the 17th century, Georg Marcgrave named it cuguacu ara.
        Marcgrave's rendering was reproduced in 1648 by his associate Willem Piso. Cuguacu ara was then adopted by John
        Ray in 1693.[4] In 1774, Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon converted cuguacu ara to cuguar, which was later
        modified to "cougar" in English.[5][6] </p>
